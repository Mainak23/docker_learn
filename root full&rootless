Rootless Podman
############################################
Definition: Runs containers as a non-root user.

Ports <1024: Cannot bind directly (privileged ports).

Example: HTTP → 80, HTTPS → 443, SSH → 22

Must use port mapping, e.g., 8080:80.

Security: Safer because a compromised container cannot escalate privileges on the host.

File system: Container files are owned by the user, cannot access arbitrary host files.

System integration: Limited; cannot modify system-level configs or services.

Networking: Uses slirp4netns for virtual network; isolated from host network unless mapped.

Auto-start: Can use systemd --user to start containers on login/reboot.

Use case: Multi-tenant servers, development, production where host security is critical.

Rootful Podman
#################################################
Definition: Runs containers as root user.

Ports <1024: Can bind directly to privileged ports.

Example: HTTP → 80, HTTPS → 443, SSH → 22

Security: Higher risk; container escape can compromise the host.

File system: Full access to host paths and devices.

System integration: Can run system-level services, manage low-level networking.

Networking: Containers can use host networking freely.

Auto-start: Can use standard systemd services for full host integration.

Use case: Admin-managed servers, legacy apps, situations needing privileged access.

Key Takeaways
#################################################
Rootless = safer, restricted access, non-root ports

Rootful = powerful, direct access, more risk

Ports <1024 restriction in rootless = feature, not bug

Rootless + reverse proxy = production-grade setup

Rootful = only if your app must access host-level resources directly
